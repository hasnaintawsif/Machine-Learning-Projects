# üè¶ Bank Customer Churn Prediction

##  Business Objective

A bank aims to identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) based on their profile and activity data. Early detection enables targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or customer service outreach, to reduce churn and maintain revenue stability.

---

##  Project Overview

This machine learning project develops a churn prediction system using structured customer data. The workflow includes:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering and preprocessing
* Model training with cross-validation
* Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
* Model evaluation with multiple performance metrics

Several models were evaluated, and the best results were obtained using **XGBoost** after hyperparameter optimization.

##  Final Model Performance ‚Äì Tuned XGBoost

| Metric    | Test Score |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Accuracy  | 0.9454     |
| Recall    | 0.9733     |
| Precision | 0.9621     |
| F1 Score  | 0.9677     |

  Key Insight

The tuned XGBoost model achieves high overall accuracy and recall, making it highly effective at identifying customers who are likely to churn. This allows the bank to take timely preventive actions.

##  How to Predict on New Data

To make predictions on new input data:

```python
import joblib
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load new feature set
x_new = pd.read_csv('your_input.csv')

# Load models
base_models = joblib.load('base_models.pkl')
meta_model = joblib.load('spam_detection.pkl')

# Create blended feature set from base model predictions
blend = np.zeros((x_new.shape[0], len(base_models)))
for i, model in enumerate(base_models):
    blend[:, i] = model.predict_proba(x_new)[:, 1]

# Predict with meta-model
predictions = meta_model.predict(blend)
```
